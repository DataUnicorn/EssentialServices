# EssentialServices
Prices of essential goods and services over the years, starting with a basic overview of essential goods in terms of price changes over years.

All data is publicly sourced.

The petroleum data is the first within the series, and covers petrol and diesel prices within South Africa at both a coastal and an in-land perspective.
The original data can be found here: https://www.sapia.org.za/Overview/Old-fuel-prices, although an excel file with all of the prices available at the time of posting, as well as the type of the fuel, the year and the whether the prices were for in-land or coastal provinces in South Africa.
